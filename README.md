# Hotel Reservations Analysis

## Overview of the project

We are a group of data analysts, curious about analysing customer behavior when making hotel reservations for the hospitality industry.
For this reason, we've decided to join this project to analyse the trends of hotel reservations, what type of travelers make the most reservations (solo travelers, business or families), costs, if there are special requests from customers or any other interesting find.

We are going to divide this project into three segments:

### Segment 1:

For this first segment, we have chosen a few questions that we would like to answer with our analysis:

- Do longer total stays have lower average prices?
- What's the average daily rate? (This question we should chnage it instead to: whats the average price per room) answered
- What's the average room price per month for each year? The idea is to answer Avg price throughout the year (2017-2018) and plot it
- What is the busiest month? answered
- Which time of the year has the longest reservations?
- Which months have more reservations with children?
- Which months include more reservations with weekends?
- From which segment do reservations come the most?

Based on the questions, we have worked on the project foundation, which means cleaning the data and performing an EDA (Explanatory Data Analysis).

Additionally, we created a repository on GitHub, where each team member created their own branch to contribute to the analysis.

Finally, we work on the creation of a database and machine learning provisional model to make predictions based on the analysis.

We decided to choose the Hotel Rservations data set because it focuses on the behavior of customers when making reservations. The data set has 36,275 data points and 19 features.

### - Plans for future work: 

For segment 2 we are going to move the mock up model to a machine learning model and create a dashboard to display our findings.
