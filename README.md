# Hotel Reservations Analysis

## Overview of the project

We are a group of data analysts, curious to analyse customer behavior when making hotel reservations for the hospitality industry in the pre-Covid years.
For this reason, we've decided to join this project to analyse the trends of hotel reservations, what type of travelers make the most reservations (solo travelers, business or families), costs, if there are special requests from customers or any other interesting find.

We are going to divide this project into three segments:

### Segment 1:

For this first segment, we have chosen a few questions that we would like to answer with our analysis:

- What's the average price per room?
- What's the average room price per month?
- Do longer total stays have lower average prices?
- What's the average daily rate?
- What is the busiest month?
- Which time of the year has the longest reservations?
- Which months have more reservations with children?
- Which months include more reservations with weekends?
- From which segment do reservations come the most?
- Can you predict if the customer is going to make a reservation online?

Based on the questions, we have worked on the project foundation, which means cleaning the data and performing EDA (Explanatory Data Analysis).

Additionally, we created a repository on GitHub, where each team member created their own branch to contribute to the analysis.

Finally, we work on the creation of a database and machine learning provisional model to make predictions based on the analysis.

We chose the Hotel Reservations data set because it focuses on customer behaviour when making reservations and will help us understand what can be done to keep the hotel industry growing. The data set has 36,275 data points and 19 features.

### Segment 2:
Once we normalized the data, we explored several classifiers:

Logistic regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest Model
SVM

Our machine learning models were run with varying percentages of train and test data, ranging from a 75/25 split to 80/20. Our results ranged from 80% to 89%, the highest being from the Random Forest Model and Decision Tree model. We are  happy with our 89% scores as Random forest and Decision trees perform well with respect to accuracy.

### Segment 3:

### - Plans for future work: 

For segment 2 we are going to move the mock up model to a machine learning model and create a dashboard to display our findings.
