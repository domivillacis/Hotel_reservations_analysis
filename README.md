# Hotel Reservations Analysis

## Overview of the project

We're a group of data analysts, interested in the hospitality industry and we're curious about analyzing customer behavior when making hotel reservations.
For this reason, we've decided to join this project to analyze the trends of hotel reservations, what type of travelers make the most reservations (solo travelers, business or families), costs, if there are special requests from customers or any other interesting find.

We are going to divide this project into three segments:

### Segment 1:

In this segment, we are going to work on the project foundation, which means cleaning the data and performing an EDA (Explanatory Data Analysis).

Additionally, we created a repository on GitHub, where each team member created their own branch to contribute to the analysis.

Finally, we work on the creation of a database and machine learning provisional model to make predictions based on the analysis.


After analyzing different data sets, we decided to choose our data set because it focuses on the behavior of customers when making reservations. The data set has 36,275 data points and 19 features.
